## 📌 Project Overview

Brain tumors are abnormal growths of cells in the brain that can be life-threatening if not detected early. This project aims to assist patients and healthcare support systems by providing:

* AI-based tumor detection from MRI images
* A user-friendly and empathetic interface
* Educational awareness about brain tumors
* Downloadable diagnostic reports

The system is designed with **accessibility, clarity, and emotional sensitivity** in mind.
